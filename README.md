Hi, Iâ€™m @G-Rex2595. I am interested in everything tech, especially software development, security, and game development.
I am currently working on home automation with Home Assistant and [my personal website](https://ArnoldRex.com). I also
have interest in switch automation with nxbt and I maintain
[a mod for Subnautica](https://github.com/G-Rex2595/SubnauticaMods/tree/master/ManageCreatureSpawns) and
[Subnautica: Below Zero](https://github.com/G-Rex2595/SubnauticaMods/tree/master/ManageCreatureSpawnsBelowZero), though
those don't get as much of my time.
